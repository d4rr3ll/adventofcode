Solutions for the 2024 [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2024)
    
The aim this year is to solve all the problems in the browser console, there is some assistance from CoPilot, but it's only used as an alternative to looking up what I needed from StackOverflow.

To use each of the solutions, open your puzzle input for each day in the browser, open the javascript console in Chrome (opt-cmd-J), and then paste either `part1.js` or `part2.js` into the console and press enter.
